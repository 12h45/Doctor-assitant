Authentication Tokens: Authentication tokens are used to verify the identity of 
a user or system. When a user logs in, they receive an authentication token, 
often in the form of a JSON Web Token (JWT) or a session token. This token is 
sent with each subsequent request to the server, allowing the server to validate
 the user's identity without the need for the user to repeatedly enter their
  username and password.

Authorization Tokens: Authorization tokens, sometimes referred to as access tokens
, determine what actions or resources a user or system is allowed to access. 
These tokens are often obtained after successful authentication and are used to
 enforce access control policies. They contain information about the user's 
 permissions and role
